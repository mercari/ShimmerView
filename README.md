ShimmerView is a collection of APIs to construct Skelton View + Shimmering Effect type loading indicator on UIKit and SwiftUI. This framework is inspired by Facebook's [Shimmer](https://github.com/facebook/Shimmer).

## Installation

### Carthage

```
github "mercari/ShimmerView"
```

## Feature
### Synchronized Effect
The shimmering effect would be effectively displayed when all the subviewsâ€™s effect in the screen is synced and animated together.

| Not Synced | Synced |
|---|---|
|![NotSynced](images/shimmer_view_not_synced.gif)|![Synced](images/shimmer_view_synced.gif)|

ShimmerView calculates its relative coordinate against the sync target and synchronize the shimmering effect with other ShimmerViews.

### Customizable
You can customize the appearance of the shimmer effect by using `ShimmerViewStyle`.
```swift
let style = ShimmerViewStyle(
    baseColor: UIColor(red: 239/255, green: 239/255, blue: 239/255, alpha: 1.0),
    highlightColor: UIColor(red: 247/255, green: 247/255, blue: 247/255, alpha: 1.0),
    duration: 1.2,
    interval: 0.4,
    effectSpan: .points(120),
    effectAngle: 0 * CGFloat.pi)
```

## Usage on SwiftUI (iOS 14.0+)
`ShimmerView` has two related APIs on SwiftUI as below:
- `ShimmerScope`
- `ShimmerElement`

You can create a custome loading indicator by combining these APIs and other `SwiftUI` APIs.
```swift
struct Placeholder: View {

    @State
    private var isAnimating: Bool = true

    var body: some View {
        ShimmerScope(isAnimating: $isAnimating) {
            HStack(alignment: .top) {
                ShimmerElement(width: 100, height: 100)
                    .cornerRadius(4)
                VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
                    ShimmerElement(height: 12)
                        .cornerRadius(4)
                    ShimmerElement(height: 12)
                        .cornerRadius(4)
                    ShimmerElement(width: 100, height: 12)
                        .cornerRadius(4)
                }
            }
            .padding(.horizontal, 16)
        }
    }
}
```

### ShimmerScope
`ShimmerScope` is a container view to sync the animation timing and style of all the `ShimmerElement`s in its content.

Please note that `ShimmerScope` uses `GeometryReader` in its body function and it doesn't fit to the content but expands to the parent view bounds.

### ShimmerElement
`ShimmerElement` is a view to show the shimmering effect animation.

`ShimmerElement` looks for `EnvironmentObject` injected by `ShimmerScope` so please make sure to use it as a sub view of `ShimmerScope`'s `content` function.

## Usage on UIKit
`ShimmerView` has four related APIs on UIKit as blow:
- `ShimmerView`
- `ShimmerSyncTarget`
- `ShimmerReplicatorView`
- `ShimmerReplicatorViewCell`

### ShimmerView
`ShimmerView` is a subclass of `UIView` that has `CAGradientLayer` as a sublayer and encapsulates the logic for the shimmering effect animation.
```swift
let shimmerView = ShimmerView()
view.addSubview(shimmerView)
shimmerView.startAnimating()
```

The style of `ShimmerView` can be customized with `ShimmerViewStyle`.
```swift
let style = ShimmerViewStyle.default
shimmerView.apply(style: style)
```

### ShimmerSyncTarget
`ShimmerView` can be used as it is, but to make the best effect, create a view or view controller that contains multiple ShimmerViews and specify the container as `ShimmerSyncTarget`. ShimmerView will calculate its relative origin against the target and adjust the effect automatically.

### ShimmerReplicatorView & ShimmerReplicatorViewCell
`ShimmerReplicatorView` will let you create a list type loading screen with a few lines of code. It replicates the `ShimmerReplicatorViewCell` provided by the `cellProvider` closure to fill the bounds of the view.

![ShimmerViewList](images/shimmer_view_list.gif)

```swift
let replicatorView = ShimmerReplicatorView(
    itemSize: .fixedSize(CGSize(width: 80, height: 80)),
    interitemSpacing: 16,
    lineSpacing: 0,
    horizontalEdgeMode: .within,
    cellProvider: { () -> ShimmerReplicatorViewCell in
        let cell = ShimmerView()
        cell.layer.cornerRadius = 8.0
        cell.layer.masksToBounds = true
        return cell
})
replicatorView.startAnimating()
```
